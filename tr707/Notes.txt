** SOUND GENERATION HARDWARE **************************************************
*******************************************************************************

The TR-707 contains 4 sound ROM chips, HN61256P of 32,768 Byte size (256Kbit)
($0000 - $7FFF) ICs 19, 22, 34 and 35. 

IC19 corrosponds to CRASH CYMBAL. 
IC22 to RIDE CYMBAL.
IC34 to BASS DRUM, SNARE DRUM, LOW TOM, and MID TOM. 
IC35 to HI TOM, HI HAT, RIM SHOT/COW BELL, and HAND CLAP/TAMBOURINE.

The CRASH CYMBAL and RIDE CYMBAL ROMs both have dedicated 6-bit DACs connected 
directly to the ROMs output data lines D7 through D2. This means that bits D0,
and D1 are not used and essentially waisted on these ROMs. A likely reason
that they work this way is that the 6-bit resistor network DAC used then was
comparatively cheap, and the circuits were for all purposes "copied & pasted"
from the TR-909.

The remaining two ROMs IC 34 & 35 store sounds in 4x$2000 (8192 dec) byte size
"slots" per ROM. Each ROM has 4 "sound slots" or rather 4 areas that can be 
played back simultaniously. Some sounds share a "slot" such as BASS DRUM 1 & 
BASS DRUM 2, or HAND CLAP & TAMBOURINE ect. The two $1000 (4096 dec) byte 
sounds are multiplexed in these areas with sound 1 getting the even addresses,
and sound 2 getting the odd addresses. So for example in IC 34 address $0000
would be the first byte of BASS DRUM 1 and $0001 would be the first byte of
BASS DRUM 2, like wise address $0002 would be the second Byte of BASS DRUM 1,
and back and fourth till address $1FFF is reached (end of the sound slot). 
This doubling up of samples in a single $2000 size "sound slot" is why certain
instruments can't be played on top of others, as there is only one voice 
channel for both sounds. 

Both IC34 & IC35 share the same 8-bit multiplying DAC (uPC624C). The DAC 
is multiplying in the sence that it takes the 8-bit sample from a sound ROM 
and multiplies it with the incoming ACCENT reference voltage (pin 14) V+ 
from the ACCENT circuit. The ACCENT circuit is basically a latch connected 
directly to a 6-Bit DAC (similar to the CRASH and RIDE circuits) which is 
then buffered (transistor in a voltage follower) to drive the DAC ACCENT in.

The 8 "sound slots" are converted to 8 separate voices by a network of 
analog switches (4051), sample and hold buffers and a Roland custom 
timing / controller chip IC30 (RD63H114) GATE ARRAY.

The basic idea here is:

1. The CPU sets up the ACCENT level and opens the ACCENT sample and hold gate.
   Now ACCENT is buffered as a DAC voltage value to be multiplied for voice 1.

2. The Roland Gate Array chip outputs the sample address to the ROM for the 
   voice. Then cycles the sound ROM Chip Enable line low -> high (enable 
   is active high), (@200Khtz) so the ROMs data output latch gets loaded with
   the correct data. On Rolands sound ROMs the /CS or CE must be cycled for 
   the current address data to latch out. Next the output ROM sample data is
   buffered in a 40H273 latch (IC36) and finally is input into the 8-bit 
   multiplying DAC.

3. The 8-bit Multiplying DAC multiplies the ACCENT voltage level by the Byte 
   value from the sound ROM latch.

4. The voltage on the DAC output goes through an analog switch mux (4051) 
   that updates an analog sample and hold buffer. This sample and hold 
   circuit is the output buffer for the voice where it then goes through 
   the TR-707s mixer and out.

5. The CPU then changes addressing to the next voice (2), which closes the 
   sample and hold inputs for the previous voice (1), and opens them for
   the current voice.
   
This cycles through updating each voice at a rate of 12.5Khtz.

The sound ROM address lines A13, A14 and /CS line are attached to the 4051 
sample and hold MUX select input lines A, B, and C, so as the analog 
voice buffer is incremented from voice to voice, the different drums in ROM
are automatically banked in.

A13 -> A
A14 -> B
/CS -> C

To demonstrate how this works I have a lookup table below. Keep in mind that 
A13=Mux input A, A14=Mux input B, ect. are the same physical line (wire).

Note: The CS line on IC34 is an inversion of the CS line on IC35.
These ROMs, IC34 & IC35, are Roland custom made mask ROMs.


The trick here is that on the Roland RD63H114 Gate Array chip the three pins 
A(3),B(5),C(7) which are connected to A13, A14 and /CS continually count up 
at a clock rate of 100KHtz.

Please note that the voice update rate is not exactly the same as the ROM 
sample playback frequency which has a few differences. The update rate on the 
ROM CE line as well as the latch that feeds the 8-bit DAC is 200KHtz. Each of 
the eight $2000 size "sound slot" (Voices) is given a seperate address counter 
on the Roland RD63H114 Gate Array and can be clocked independantly.

This means that the actual sample playback rate can reach a max of 200Khtz 
during the short 12.5KHtz time that a voice is muxed in. It might be possible 
to clock samples at a higher rate than 200KHtz with the Roland Gate Array, 
however, the addresses wouldn't be accessible as actual output bytes because 
the ROM CE line needs to be strobed for the data output latch to be updated 
on these Hitachi HN61256 mask ROMs.

The Cymbal and Ride are not part of this multiplexing and have no upper limit
on sample playback rate.

A workaround for higher fidelity *might* be possible by overclocking the 
Roland Gate Array, or simply increasing the ROM and data latch CE frequency 
via an external oscillator. However at this high a frequency (200KHtz) the 
error of the sample and hold circuits themselves (time to charge) could come 
into play first.

Note on HiHat envelope:
There is one extra transistor based VCA for the Hi Hat after the output 
sample & hold buffer. Its used when the closed Hi Hat is sounded for a quick
decay, and can probably be adjusted by altering C70, C71, or the connected 
filter resistors.

2.A Setting Pitch For Each Voice
*******************************************************************************

The clock lines that determine sample playback rate are hard-wired to the 
Roland Gate Array and are not programmible via the TR-707 CPU. Though modding 
the TR-707 so that each voice can be shifted in pitch is as easy as 
disconnecting the clock lines and adding in your own. The clock line signals 
used are a standard 0 to +5V TTL compatable square wave.

The CRASH CYMBAL uses a 50KHtz source clock rate into pin 11 of IC25 (4013).
The RIDE CYMBAL uses the same 50Khtz clock into pin 3 of IC25 (4013).
The actual sample playback rate is divided by two by the 4013 chip. An input 
of 50KHtz = 25KHtz actual playback sample rate. To use your own sample rate 
simply cut the trace leading to these seperate pins and connect your clock
lines.

The rest of the voices use clock lines that are connected to pins 56, 57, 
59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 of the Roland Gate Array. These clock lines increment 
the internal address counter for each of the eight $2000 size memory 
"sound slots".

The "sound slots" that hold two drums (ex. Snare 1,2) are clocked at twice
the sample frequency since only every other address that is incremented is 
the actual sample data.

 CLOCK PIN TO VOICE TABLE
+-------------------------------------------------+
|Clock Frequency| Gate Pin  Sound                 |
+---------------+---------------------------------+
| 50.0 KHtz     | Pin 56 -> Bass Drum 1,2         |
| 50.0 KHtz     | Pin 57 -> Snare Drum 1,2        |
| 12.5 KHtz     | Pin 59 -> Low Tom               |
| 12.5 KHtz     | Pin 60 -> Mid Tom               |
| 12.5 KHtz     | Pin 61 -> Hi Tom                |
| 25.0 KHtz     | Pin 62 -> Hi Hat                |
| 50.0 KHtz     | Pin 63 -> Rimshot / Cowbell     |
| 50.0 KHtz     | Pin 64 -> Hand Clap / Tambourine|
+---------------+---------------------------------+

The line connected to pin 57 also is the source clock signal for the Cymbal 
and Ride. Cutting it will disable normal operation of these voices.
I recommend lifting the pin off the trace to connect your own clock line.

2.B TR-707 Sound ROM Format
*******************************************************************************
The byte format is a simple 8-bit word unsigned PCM stream. The 8-bit 
multiplying DAC is unsigned, so data byte $00 is the lowest voltage output 
while $FF the highest. Likewise $80 is the AC waveform center.

Even though the TR-707 sound ROMs work using standard EPROM / ROM address, 
data and control lines (aside from different Chip Enable, Chip Select levels), 
the address lines are incompatable with most common EPROM pinouts making them 
unreadable in a standard EPROM reader / writer. My guess is that the two 
reasons for this are first, a cheap copy protection, second the trace layout 
on the PCB might have been easier to design with the address lines that way.

Here is the corrected pinout for IC19,IC22,IC34,IC35 alongside a 32Kbyte EPROM.

If you attempt to read your own TR-707 or TR-727 sound ROMs please note
that /CS or CE must be strobed in order to latch the correct data out 
for a given address on these chips.

In my tests with a Needhams EMP-11 programmer I can use the Hitachi 
27256 EPROM setting to read the ROM as long as I pull CE to Vcc and use 
/OE line on the /CS line, along with re-routing the address lines to 
their correct place for the 27C256 pinout. To read IC35 I added an 
inverter to the CS input (74HC00 used as inverter).

Reading IC19 Crash Cymbal and IC22 Ride Cymbal is the same as reading IC34,
except for the rearrangement of address lines.
